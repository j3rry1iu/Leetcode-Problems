The trick with this one is to add a zero to both ends of the given array. This doesn't change the actual outcome and allows the
algorithmn to be much simpler. Then you iterate through the array and check if there is a plant at that index, the one before and 
the one after. If there isn't, place a flower in that spot and move on.
